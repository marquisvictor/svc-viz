An open-source Python software package for visualizing SVC model coefficient surfaces with minimal code enhancing reproducibility and replicability in these models. 

### Features
- Enables visualization of coefficient estimates from SVC models, adhering to visualization best practices as outlined in Irekponor and Oshan (in preparation).
- Facilitates exploration of replicability by comparing coefficient surfaces across two different SVC models.
- Provides a user-friendly 3-panel visualization template for systematic and consistent analysis.
- Offers simplicity and compatibility with any SVC model, ensuring broad applicability with minimal effort.
