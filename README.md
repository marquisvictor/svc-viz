The spatially varying coefficient visualization (svc-viz) tool is an open-source Python software package designed to faciilitate the visualization of SVC model results with minimal effort. Svc-viz provides a codified interface for interpreting the results of local regression models based on the existing best practices for visualizing these models, requiring only a minimal amount of coding.

### Features
- Enables visualization of coefficient estimates from SVC models, adhering to visualization best practices as outlined in Irekponor and Oshan (in preparation).
- Facilitates exploration of replicability by comparing coefficient surfaces across two different SVC models.
- Provides a user-friendly 3-panel visualization template for systematic and consistent analysis.
- Offers simplicity and compatibility with any SVC model, ensuring broad applicability with minimal effort.
